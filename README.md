GoRuby, an implementation of Ruby written in Go

## Disclaimer

This project is not a working one. I didn't have the time to pull out a running release for it. The current implementation is far away from being useful, as it just calls the Ruby interpreter on the system. This was by intention for getting started with mspec and rubyspec. It was not changed until then. The idea was to migrate slowly from this fake implementation to the real one. 

This has not yet begun!

## Contribution

If anyone wants to help to get the project to the real implementation please ping me or fork it and send a pull request.
